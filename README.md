A simple "Hello World" project to start comprehending React!

#### A tic-tac-toe game that:
* lets you play tic-tac-toe,
* indicates when one player has won the game,
* stores the history of moves during the game,
* allows players to jump back in time to see older versions of the game board.

#### Some ideas for improvements:
* Bold the currently-selected item in the move list.
* Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
* Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or * descending order.
* When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
